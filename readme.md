# Engi's Farm (prototype)

## Description
Would you rather stick to a business you've been managing for almost a year and is currently thriving, or move to an obscure farm passed down to you from your grandfather *ten years ago*? Pshh, is that even a question? Of course you'd throw your life away for that farm. That's exactly what Engi did.

## How to Run
